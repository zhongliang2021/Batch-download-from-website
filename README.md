# Batch-download-from-website
The function of this batch download program is to unzip the zip file downloaded from the website and put the images from the same factory into the same folder. 

To use the batch download program, you need to change the "total address" to the address of the Python files named "Downloader" , and create a new file folder called "Cache" at the same address.

In addition, it is necessary to edit the name of the file to be downloaded based on the form of the Download-directory.This operation will affect the location where the images are stored. Since, we assume that the images from the same factory will have the same id number and should be put into a same folder.
